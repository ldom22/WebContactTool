# WebContactTool
A web tool that makes it easy to gather contacts at an event. Live at http://1-dot-appfsl-1028.appspot.com

This is a very simple web tool useful for recruiters (as an example). A recruiter can:

1) Go to the main page and create an event.
2) A form is shown for capturing a contact's name, last name, and email
3) When a contact fill the form, he/she immediately gets a confirmation email.
4) When the event is finished, the recruiter clicks the finish button
5) The recruiter immediately gets an email with a table containing all captured contacts.
